            <title>Why is Zeppoli's Italian Restaurant &amp; Wine Shop in First?</title>
            <p>Zeppoli's Italian Restaurant &amp; Wine Shop has the best gnocchi I have ever had. Even though that pasta is my favorite, everyone of their pastas are handmade with love and care and you can especially taste it. I believe this is the best Italian place in all of Blacksburg. But that's not the only reason this place got first. It was also because of it being a hidden gem behind a gas station and some other stores. It has low lighting throughout the whole store, which adds to the romantic atmosphere. Overall, I can't say anything negative about this place other than the fact that it is a little on the expensive side, but it is so worth it. <fig>
